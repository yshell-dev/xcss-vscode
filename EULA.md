# End User License Agreement (EULA)

## 1. Introduction

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") governs your use of the XCSS VSCode Extension ("Extension"), provided under the MIT License. By installing or using the Extension, you agree to comply with all terms outlined in this agreement.

## 2. License for XCSS VSCode Extension

The Extension itself, including all associated source code and assets outside the embedded ./package folder, is licensed under the MIT License. This permits free use, modification, distribution, and private or commercial use under the terms of the MIT License.

## 3. Embedded ./package Folder

The Extension includes an embedded folder called ./package which contains a bundled npm package build. This folder is distributed with an alternate set of documentation and licensing terms specific to its contents.

### 3.1 Alternate Documentation

The ./package folder includes its own documentation files which supersede the Extension’s main documentation for any components or scripts contained therein. Users should refer to those documents for usage, build instructions, and contribution guidelines specific to the npm package.

### 3.2 Licensing of ./package

The ./package folder may be subject to a different license than the MIT License applied to the core Extension. It is your responsibility to review and comply with the license terms provided within the ./package folder before using, modifying, or distributing its contents.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Extension and the contents of the ./package folder are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The authors disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Extension or the ./package folder contents, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

## 6. Acceptance

By using the XCSS VSCode Extension, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Agreement including the special provisions pertaining to the embedded ./package folder.
